# Little Town of Life

This repository hosts design collateral for the "Smallville+++" Tkinter life simulation concept. The core deliverable is a comprehensive implementation brief compiled for GPT-based coding agents.

## Contents

- `docs/Smallville+++_Implementation_Brief.md` â€” step-by-step plan covering assets, architecture, simulation psychology, safety, testing, and prompts for autonomous coding agents.

## Getting Started

1. Review the implementation brief for the proposed project layout and simulation roadmap.
2. Follow the milestone plan to incrementally build the simulator or delegate individual tasks to an agent using the supplied prompts.
